That link will tell you where you can watch it.)</em></p><p>Hello hello everyone. My name is Nick but everything I make gets released under Nikolyst. Welcome <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karn_Evil_9" title="Karn Evil 9 by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer">back my friends to the show that never ends</a></span> to the umpteenth iteration of my personal website. New domain, new look, new goals. In no particular order:</p><h4 class="align-center">Goal #1 - Be real about my mental health reality</h4><p>I've struggled with what I thought was anxiety for many years. Come last summer however, I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and boy did a lot of things start to make sense. Now normally ("normally", <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XgyGhjvFUg" title="this is a load of barnacles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pshhhh</a>), the professional world doesn't like to talk about mental health and sometimes even sees a job candidate that makes any mention of mental health issues (even if things are better than they were in the past) as an unjustifiable risk. Maybe I can't change that in the world of IT (my day job) but I can be as open as I want on here. The horrendous irony is that means I need to refrain from disclosing my creative persona to any employers for as long as I am an employee but that's how this world works. As long as I do that, I can be as open as I please about whatever mental health struggles I'm currently going through. More on why I want to share these struggles publicly in a future post.</p><h4 class="align-center">Goal #2 - Make, finish, &amp; release more things</h4><p>I like doing creative things but my OCD tends to get stuck on perfection: trying to make the perfect music, trying to find the perfect tools, etc. Ironically, all that time obsessing over making something perfect (and let's be honest, there's ain't a single damn thing in this world that's perfect) results in me failing to make anything substantial at all. Maybe some rough sketches in a DAW but that's it. While I will never be "cured" of OCD, I certainly plan on finishing more projects by utilizing techniques I learned in an intensive therapy program last summer. I want to not just release these finished projects but release them with price tags. I love the theoretical idea of Creative Commons licenses and the culture surrounding it but I can't release everything for free if I want to make some supplementary income from my creative works (and maybe someday a primary income but we'll see what happens). I still plan to release some things for free though (such as <a href="https://nikolyst.xyz/001/">glitchVids</a> which you can get right now) so be on the lookout.</p><h4 class="align-center">Goal #3 - Have a central place to showcase my stuff</h4><p>You can't create a code repository on Bandcamp and it makes no sense to put a music album on GitHub. One function of this site is to showcase every creative project of mine regardless of what form it takes: music, visuals, code, etc. I've got nice categories visible on the main page so you can choose whether you want to see everything or just a particular category.</p><h4 class="align-center">Final goal (that I can think of) - Content longevity</h4><p>I've created and recreated my personal website countless times since third grade (1998 for me I think). On the off chance I write a blog post that helps even a single person in some way, I want it to be accessible to others for more than just a few months or a couple years. This time around I'm using an offline static site generator that publishes to GitHub Pages. I have a high degree of data redundancy now so recovery in case of a disaster should be (to use a word my computer science professors utilized that absolutely infuriated my undiagnosed OCD brain) trivial.</p><hr><p>Alright, there's my intro.
