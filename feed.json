            "content_html": "<p>While I had originally planned to launch my Patreon today, it is not quite ready yet. I'm still working on the finer details of my reward tiers plus I have a lot of old projects to track down. One of the rewards I'll be offering on one of my tiers is access to <strong>every</strong> unreleased project I've <strong>ever</strong> worked on (as long as I still have the files). Most of my music projects are organized in one giant folder but I have other projects scattered throughout my various hard drives. I want to have a large number of these projects gathered up before I launch my Patreon.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://nikolyst.com/media/posts/3/publii_musicfoldersize2019.png\" width=\"334\" height=\"187\">\n<figcaption >And there's more projects hiding elsewhere on my computer too!</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>This will take a bit but it will help me find projects I want to revisit plus it will give all of my patrons plenty of things to listen to and play with on day one. If you become a patron, you'll get access to these projects under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. More on this decision and my Patreon later! :D</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>After pondering this for way too many months now, I finally decided I'm launching my Patreon on Sunday, December 15th. With the variety of things I do and the stress that I experience when I end up rushing something out that feels unfinished, Patreon seems like a breath of fresh air. Do I have specific monetary goals here? Only to slowly start making money from my creative processes. <strong>I absolutely LOVE my current day job and I currently have zero plans to leave it. </strong>That said, I'm currently living with my parents with no ability to pay actual rent and no emergency funds. I gotta change that. Pateron will hopefully help.</p>\n<p>What on earth am I going to share through Patreon? Anything! Everything! Nothing in particular! Whatever creative stuff I do is fair game: music, sounds, games, circuit bending, custom electronics, glitch art, physical art, etc. I haven't decided what all the tiers and rewards will look like but the lowest tier will be $1 per month. Every little bit will help!</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on my social media to get the link as soon as I go live.
